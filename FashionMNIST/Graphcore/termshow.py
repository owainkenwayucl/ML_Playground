# Micro Library to print out a greyscale 2D python data structure as an
# "ASCII-art" to the terminal.

# Owain Kenway, The third of November in the year of our Lord two thousand
#               and twenty-two.

# Assumptions: The 2D structure is "well formed" as in the fields are all a 
#              double between 0.0 and 1.0.
#              The structure is rectangular i.e. width is the same for each
#              row.
